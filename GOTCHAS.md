# Gotchas

A running log of things that cost time on this project. Agents read it at
the start of every session and add to it when they hit something new (see
the Session protocol in `AGENTS.md`). Never delete an entry — update its
`Status` instead.

Lessons from earlier builds are in the skill, not here:
`.claude/skills/webflow-build/lessons/` (one file per area). Read the file
for the area you work in. Entries tagged `Scope: template-candidate` are
collected from client repos into those files.

## Entry format

```md
### YYYY-MM-DD · Short title
- Area: designer | css | loader | release | mcp | ci | js | perf
- Scope: project | template-candidate
- Symptom: what was observed
- Cause: why it happened
- Fix: what was done, or the workaround
- Status: open | fixed <sha> | upstreamed wf-template <sha>
- Found by: claude | codex | human
```
