# Recipe: Finsweet Attributes as a bundled module

Use this when a project needs Finsweet Attributes (List, Combo Box, …).
Finsweet is bundled from the pinned npm package and started by our own
module. **Never** add Finsweet's `<script src="…@finsweet/attributes…">`
tag to Webflow's custom code: a CDN tag can't be ordered against our
bundle, isn't version-pinned with the release, and loads every page.

The markup stays exactly as the Finsweet docs describe (`fs-list-element`,
`fs-combobox-element`…); only the loading changes.

## Add it to a project

1. Copy the files:
   - `finsweet.ts`, `finsweet-registry.ts` → `src/modules/`
   - `finsweet-dist.d.ts` → `src/`
   - `finsweet.mjs` → `scripts/`
2. In `package.json` scripts: `"finsweet": "node scripts/finsweet.mjs"`.
3. In `src/index.ts`, import `initFinsweet` and run it **last**:
   `run('finsweet', initFinsweet);` (it starts a microtask later, so
   attributes set by earlier modules are seen). With page transitions, call
   `resetFinsweet()` when a page leaves.
4. Choose the attributes: `pnpm finsweet add list combobox`
   (`pnpm finsweet list` shows them all). The first `add` installs
   `@finsweet/attributes` at an exact version. Only the chosen attributes
   are bundled (List + Combo Box ≈ 120 KB minified).
5. `pnpm check && pnpm build`, commit `src/`, `scripts/`, `dist/`,
   `package.json`, the lockfile and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
6. Remove any Finsweet `<script>` tag from Webflow's custom code.

To update Finsweet later: `pnpm update @finsweet/attributes`, then
`pnpm finsweet sync` (the distribution file names change per version).

## How it works

- `finsweet-registry.ts` (written by `pnpm finsweet`) maps each chosen
  attribute to its file in the package's `dist/`, read from the package's
  own loader (`attributes.js`).
- `finsweet.ts` does what the CDN loader does: creates
  `window.FinsweetAttributes` (`scripts`, `modules`, `process`, `load`,
  `push`, `destroy`), finds which chosen attributes the page uses (any
  `fs-<name>…` attribute), and starts only those. `loadAttribute('list')`
  resolves with the List instances for modules that need them.

## Known issues

- **Install fails with 404** (`@finsweet/attributes-list` not found): the
  2.x package lists ~30 per-attribute packages as dependencies that were
  never published. `pnpm finsweet add` writes a pnpm override (`'-'`) for
  each into `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; the code is all in the package's `dist/`.
- **Combo Box** differs from its docs (needs a clear element, sorts options
  by value, finds parts by position): see `lessons/js.md`.
