# Lessons: Loader, release and CI

The three snippets, releases with jsDelivr tags, and the CI checks.

Harvested from client builds made from this template (`Scope:
template-candidate` entries in their `GOTCHAS.md`). Module and file names
refer to the project the lesson came from; Status is that project's.

### 2026-10-02 · Filling in REPO in loader.html breaks the browser tests
- Area: ci
- Symptom: The first push after setup fails `pnpm test` with
  `Expected: "https://<org>.github.io/wf-example/"`, `Received:
  ".../<repo>/"`, so staging never deploys.
- Cause: `tests/environment-switcher.spec.mjs` replaced the `REPO`
  placeholder with `wf-example` and hardcoded that name in `stage` and
  `release`. The README checklist tells every project to fill in `REPO`,
  so the replacement no longer happens and the hardcoded URLs no longer
  match the bundle's.
- Fix: the test reads the repo name back from `var SITE = "…"` in the
  loader and builds `stage`/`release` from it. That works whether or not
  REPO has been filled in.
- Status: fixed in this repo (same commit as this entry); not upstreamed

### 2026-10-09 · Swapping the stylesheet href in 2b causes a full-page layout shift
- Area: loader
- Symptom: after a site was cut over to the template's loader, Lighthouse
  CLS on desktop rose from ~0.001 to 0.2–0.5 (0.52, 0.28 and 0.22 on three
  page types). The parity check missed it (see the parity entry below).
- Cause: Embed 2b set `base.href` from the staging URL to the release URL,
  and the footer loader set it again. Assigning a new href to a `<link>`
  drops its rules until the new file arrives. Repo CSS scales the type, so
  the page rendered at the wrong scale, then jumped. The 2b comment said
  the href was "settled before first paint"; it isn't, the staging sheet
  from 2a is already in flight.
- Fix: `WFC.setCSS` in 2b loads the target next to the current sheet and
  removes the old one on `load` (keeps it on `error`); the id moves at
  once and an unchanged URL is a no-op. The footer loader calls it, with
  a plain-href fallback for an older 2b. `tests/css-swap.spec.mjs` covers
  it. CLS back to 0.001–0.003 on the same pages.
- Status: fixed in the template's loader.html (2b and footer code must be
  re-pasted into Webflow)

### 2026-10-09 · Setting RELEASE in loader.html breaks CI
- Area: release
- Symptom: every push after the first release failed CI with
  "loader.html must ship with `var RELEASE = null;`", so staging stopped
  deploying (production was unaffected; it is pinned to the tag).
- Cause: the release commit wrote `RELEASE = "0.0.1"` into `loader.html`
  because AGENTS.md said to keep it "identical to what is installed". The
  repo copy must keep `null`; the browser tests enforce it. The installed
  version exists only in the head code pasted into Webflow.
- Fix: `loader.html` back to `null`; the installed release is recorded in
  AGENTS.md › Project facts. AGENTS.md › Snippets are not versioned and
  README › Release now say "identical except RELEASE".
- Status: fixed in the template's AGENTS.md and README

### 2026-10-09 · The staging link in Embed 2a is render-blocking on production
- Area: loader
- Symptom: on production pages Lighthouse lists the staging `styles.css`
  (GitHub Pages) as a render-blocking request, ~1.4 s on simulated slow
  4G, although 2b immediately swaps in the release sheet.
- Cause: 2a is a static `<link>` to the staging sheet so the Designer
  canvas can show repo CSS. The browser starts fetching it as soon as it
  parses the Embed, and a stylesheet in the body blocks rendering of the
  content after it until it has loaded, even once the swap has removed it.
- Fix: not implemented. Proposed: the head code writes the release
  stylesheet `<link id="wfc-css">` itself when `RELEASE` is set and the
  page is not on `*.webflow.io`; 2b then removes the 2a link (the canvas
  never runs 2b, so it keeps showing staging). Needs a test that public
  pages never request the staging sheet once a release is set.
- Status: open

### 2026-10-09 · A parity check on settled pages misses layout shifts
- Area: ci
- Symptom: after a loader change, a check comparing computed styles and
  boxes between the old and new install passed 1:1, while Lighthouse CLS
  had gone from ~0.001 to 0.2–0.5.
- Cause: the check waits for the page to settle, so a transient state
  (no stylesheet for a few hundred ms) is never seen.
- Fix: after any change to the loader snippets or how CSS reaches the
  page, also run Lighthouse (or PageSpeed) CLS on a few page types, before
  and after, on the same host. Compare like with like (mobile/desktop,
  same throttling).
- Status: documented

### 2026-10-09 · Lighthouse and PageSpeed don't emulate prefers-reduced-motion
- Area: ci
- Symptom: after the page loader was skipped under
  `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, Lighthouse and PageSpeed runs still
  showed it, so the change could not be verified there.
- Cause: Lighthouse and PageSpeed run with the default `no-preference`;
  neither has a setting for the media feature.
- Fix: measure reduced-motion behaviour separately (Playwright
  `page.emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' })` or Chrome DevTools
  Rendering › Emulate CSS media feature). Don't count a reduced-motion
  change as a score improvement: the score reflects the full-motion path.
- Status: documented

### 2026-10-06 · Body Embed stylesheet: page paints unscaled, then jumps
- Area: loader
- Symptom: the designer saw the hero (and every page) flash. A filmstrip showed
  the first paint at Webflow's 16px with a fallback font, then a jump to
  the repo's fluid scale once repo CSS arrived; `styles.css` was fetched three times.
- Cause: repo CSS comes from a `<link>` in a body Embed, which doesn't block
  rendering like a head stylesheet; the Embed script and the footer loader
  each rewrote its href with a new `Date.now()`, and every href change
  drops the sheet and fetches it again (the cancelled fetch also fires
  `error`); Inter (`font-display: swap`) loaded late.
- Fix: loader.html — head code preloads the Inter woff2, adds
  `html.wfc-css-wait body { visibility: hidden }` (3 s fallback) and one
  shared `WFC.v` cache-buster; the Embed script leaves the static link for
  the canvas and appends a fresh `#wfc-css` link with the final URL, whose
  load/error lifts the wait; the footer loader only sets the href when the
  URL really differs. Verified by serving staging with the patched snippets.
- Status: fixed in loader.html; the snippets had to be re-pasted
- Found by: human + claude

### 2026-10-02 · Static localhost link is requested by public visitors
- Area: loader
- Symptom: Published pages request `http://localhost:3000/styles.css`; can
  block render and trigger Chrome's local-network-access prompt.
- Cause: The canvas Embed carries a static localhost `<link>` so the
  Designer can see local CSS; the script that removes it runs after the
  browser has already started the request.
- Fix: two projects removed the static link independently and create it from script only in dev mode. Trade-off: the
  canvas then shows staging CSS only.
- Status: fixed in the template — the Embed has no static localhost link; the dev link is created by script in dev mode only

### 2026-10-02 · VER lives in two snippets and a placeholder 404s at launch
- Area: release
- Symptom: Prod CSS and JS both 404 the moment a custom domain is attached.
- Cause: `VER = "X.Y.Z"` is never exercised on `*.webflow.io`, and a release
  must bump VER in both the Embed and the footer snippet.
- Fix: one project kept a single `RELEASE` value in the head config (`null` until the
  first tag) that the other snippets read.
- Status: fixed in the template — one RELEASE in head code; null serves staging with a console error instead of 404ing
- Found by: human

### 2026-10-02 · The add -f dist / untrack release ritual is error-prone
- Area: release
- Symptom: Empty release tags, re-cut versions, `dist/` swept into unrelated
  commits.
- Cause: `dist/` is gitignored except in release commits. One project re-cut
  v1.1.1 with a tree identical to v1.1.0.
- Fix: three projects committed `dist/` permanently and fail CI on
  `git diff --exit-code -- dist`.
- Status: fixed in the template — dist/ is committed; CI fails on drift; dev builds stay in memory
