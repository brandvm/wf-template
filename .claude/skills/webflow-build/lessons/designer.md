# Lessons: Designer and canvas

How the Designer, the canvas and publishing behave: combos, components, tag styles, forms, grids, empty elements.

Harvested from client builds made from this template (`Scope:
template-candidate` entries in their `GOTCHAS.md`). Module and file names
refer to the project the lesson came from; Status is that project's.

### 2026-10-05 · A two-class combo can't be edited from a three-class element
- Area: designer
- Symptom: The value for Section + Is Hero had to be entered, but every
  hero element is Section + Is Dark + Is Hero. Selecting it in the
  Designer edits the chain `.section.is-dark.is-hero`, which would
  not reach a plain `section is-hero`.
- Cause: Webflow edits the exact chain on the selected element.
- Fix: in the selector field, remove the extra class (Is Dark), set
  the value on Section › Is Hero, then add the class back. The CSS
  `.section.is-hero` still matches the three-class element on the page.
  When planning combos, keep shared values on the shortest chain.

### 2026-10-05 · Gradient layers have no size/tile in the Designer
- Area: designer
- Symptom: A repeating tick pattern (`repeating-linear-gradient`) could
  not be built in the Designer. Gradient layers offer no size or tile
  settings, and Custom properties refuse `background-size`,
  `background-repeat` and `background-image` (native properties).
- Cause: Webflow only exposes size/tile on image layers, and has no
  repeating gradient.
- Fix: the designer builds the gradient in the Designer with hard stops
  (0% → 17.65% Field, then transparent). The tiling
  (`background-size: 17px 1em; background-repeat: repeat-x`) goes in
  repo CSS, tagged `designer-cant`. The MCP could write it into the class
  (`update_style` accepts it), but nothing in the Designer would show it,
  so it would be a hidden override. the designer chose the repo.
- Status: workaround confirmed

### 2026-10-06 · Webflow form and dropdown defaults leak through our classes
- Area: designer
- Symptom: the designer spotted the 10px under native inputs. An audit found
  more: every Form Block (`.w-form`) adds 15px below; `.w-dropdown-toggle`
  pads 20px 40px 20px 20px; `.w-dropdown-link` sets colour #222;
  `.w-dropdown` has auto left and right margins.
- Cause: `webflow.css` defaults apply wherever our class doesn't set the
  property. Here the Form Blocks had no class at all: the WHTML workaround
  moves the class onto the inner `<form>` and clears the wrapper.
- Fix: in Webflow, not repo CSS (Designer first, so it stays editable):
  margin-bottom 0 on Select Input; padding 0 on Select Toggle; colour
  inherit on Select Option; left and right margin 0 on Select; new class
  **Form Block** (margin-bottom 0) on every Form Block wrapper. Give every new Form Block that
  class, and check new form or dropdown classes against these defaults.

### 2026-10-06 · Webflow rewrites roles and drops attributes on publish
- Area: designer
- Symptom: the bundled custom-select never initialised on staging; a static
  `<dialog>` specimen was invisible; Link Blocks gained attributes nobody set.
- Cause: on publish Webflow
  - writes `role="list"` on every List element (our `role="listbox"` and
    `hidden` are gone), so `[role="listbox"]` lookups find nothing;
  - strips the `open` attribute from a `<dialog>`;
  - adds `title` and `aria-label` (equal to the visible text) to Link Blocks.
- Fix: modules find lists by class and set the ARIA role themselves
  (`custom-select.ts`). The style guide's lightbox specimen carries
  `data-static`, and repo CSS hides only `.lightbox:not([open]):not([data-static])`.
  Never rely on a role or boolean attribute surviving a Webflow element;
  check the published HTML.
- Status: fixed (custom-select, lightbox rule)

### 2026-10-06 · Native `<button type="submit">` in Webflow forms
- Area: designer
- Symptom: after replacing the FormButton inputs with a DOM `<button>`
  holding the button colour class, the button had UA padding, border and background;
  in the footer it stretched to the form width; on staging it showed
  `disabled` + `w-form-loading`.
- Cause: a native button keeps UA styles unless the class resets them; a
  flex-column form stretches its children; Webflow's Turnstile spam check
  disables every submit until the form scrolls into view and gets a token
  (webflow.js, same for input submits).
- Fix: Button class sets padding 0, border width 0, background transparent,
  font-family and colour inherit, cursor pointer. The newsletter form sets
  align-items flex-start. The Turnstile state is expected; test submits in a real
  browser, not headless.

### 2026-10-06 · Inter Variable narrows large type (optical size)
- Area: designer
- Symptom: Webflow headings were narrower than the prototype at the same
  size and tracking (hero H1 336 vs 375px).
- Cause: Inter Variable v4 has an `opsz` axis; with the default
  `font-optical-sizing: auto` large text uses the tighter Display cut. The
  prototype's Google Fonts Inter (wght axis only) is the Text cut everywhere.
- Fix: Body tag style › custom property `font-optical-sizing: none`.

### 2026-10-06 · Designer canvas draws a templateless grid as 2×2
- Area: designer
- Symptom: icon glyphs in a square box sat top-left on the canvas but centred on staging.
- Cause: `display: grid` with no rows/columns set publishes as a one-cell
  grid, but the Designer previews its default 2×2 template.
- Fix: centre single children with flex (justify/align center), not grid.
  Every grid class sets both tracks explicitly (designer): a missing
  `grid-template-rows` / `-columns` is given `auto`, which matches the
  implicit track, so published CSS behaves the same. Breakpoints inherit
  from base.
- Status: fixed (every grid class, 2026-10-06)
- Found by: human

### 2026-10-06 · Canvas `.wf-empty`: empty elements show as 75px boxes or vanish
- Area: designer
- Symptom: on the Designer canvas, empty shapes (markers, guide lines,
  timeline dot/line, overlays, fades) showed as dashed placeholder boxes;
  once given padding, em-sized ones collapsed to 0×0. Published pages were fine.
- Cause: the canvas adds `.wf-empty` to any element without content:
  `padding-bottom/right: 75px`, `font-size: 0`, `line-height: 0` and a dashed
  outline. em sizes then compute to 0. (First guessed margin — wrong.)
- Fix: every class used on an empty element sets padding 0 on all sides and
  `font-size: inherit` (the live default, so the published page is unchanged).
  Do this for every class used on an empty element: markers, lines, dots,
  overlays, fades, dividers, swatches, map frames and empty wrappers.

### 2026-10-06 · Split text in Webflow Spans flattens when edited
- Area: designer
- Symptom: editing a numbered step's text from the Settings panel turned
  the styled pieces (marker, number, title, description) into one plain sentence.
- Cause: the importer makes every `<span>` a Webflow text Span; Spans inside a
  text parent (button, paragraph, figcaption, heading, link) are rich-text
  children, and editing the parent's text rewrites them.
- Fix: rebuild each piece as a custom element with tag `span` (same classes and
  attributes), move its text node in, remove the old Span. Standalone Spans in
  plain blocks (chips, labels) are fine.
- Status: fixed for site content

### 2026-10-06 · Conditional classes are typed slugs, not linked styles
- Area: designer
- Symptom: a component with the conditional class *Is Caps* published
  `figure is-cap`, so the figure lost its placement.
- Cause: the component's "conditional classes" are a custom `class`
  attribute with a Conditional text value. The value is a typed string
  (`is-cap`, one letter short of `is-caps`), not a reference to a style, so
  a typo publishes silently and a class rename in the Style Manager never
  reaches it. The API can't read or edit the value.
- Fix: corrected in the Designer. After wiring a conditional
  class, check the published class list; re-check these attributes whenever
  a combo is renamed.

### 2026-10-06 · em spacing moved from a button to its wrapper changes size
- Area: designer
- Symptom: a section's button sat 4–5px lower than the prototype, so the
  section ran long and every later section shifted.
- Cause: the prototype put `margin-top: Content/Gap` (em) on the button,
  whose own font size is 0.875em. In Webflow the button is a C | Button
  instance, which can't take page styles, so the margin went on its
  wrapper at 1em, and the same em value computes larger.
- Fix: scale the wrapper's value by the button's font ratio,
  `calc(Content/Gap * 0.875)`, in the Designer. When spacing
  moves from a sized element to its wrapper, convert the em value.

### 2026-10-02 · Removing a rule locally does not remove it on the canvas
- Area: designer
- Symptom: A deleted CSS rule still applies in the Designer while `pnpm dev`
  runs.
- Cause: The canvas never runs scripts, so both the staging and the
  localhost `<link>` stay live. They are additive; staging's copy of the
  rule remains.
- Fix: push and wait for staging, or temporarily comment out the `wfc-css`
  link in the Embed.
- Status: documented — v3 canvas shows staging only by default; applies only while the temporary localhost link is in use
- Found by: human

### 2026-10-08 · An Embed with a script hides its stylesheet link on the canvas
- Area: designer
- Symptom: with the stylesheet `<link>` and its `<script>` in one HTML
  Embed, the Designer canvas showed none of the repo CSS.
- Cause: the canvas never runs scripts, and it skips an Embed that
  contains a `<script>` as a whole, so the `<link>` beside it never
  renders there.
- Fix: two Embeds in the global component: one with only the `<link>`,
  then one with only the `<script>` (loader.html pieces 2a and 2b). Keep
  any canvas-visible markup (stylesheets, icon fonts) out of script Embeds.
- Status: fixed in the template's loader.html
- Found by: human

### 2026-10-09 · Image Load (lazy/eager) is per instance; preload doesn't fix render delay
- Area: designer
- Symptom: the LCP image (a hero, or a CMS image on a template page) was
  lazy-loaded. The image element's Load setting (Lazy / Eager) isn't
  exposed through the MCP or the API, and on a component it is set per
  instance.
- Cause: Designer-only setting.
- Fix: set Load › Eager on each LCP instance in the Designer (a manual
  step). To start the download earlier, page head code can add
  `<link rel="preload" as="image" href="…">`; on a CMS template page the
  href can bind a field with
  `{{wf {&quot;path&quot;:&quot;<field-slug>&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;ImageRef&quot;\} }}`.
  That only moves the download: when Lighthouse shows LCP "render delay",
  the cause is render-blocking resources (stylesheets and scripts before
  the image), which preload does not change.
