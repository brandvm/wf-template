# Manual Designer steps

Everything the Webflow MCP can't do, for a person to do in the Designer.
Claude adds a row the moment it hits a limit, with *why* the API can't;
the person marks it done; Claude then reads the result back (or checks it on
the canvas when the API can't read it) and says so.

Common reasons, so they don't need re-explaining (see the skill's
`lessons/mcp.md`):
- a value mixing a variable with `calc()`, a gradient or a shadow;
- conditional visibility on a CMS field; a list sourced from a
  multi-reference or multi-image field; "exclude current item";
- a link to the current CMS item, in a list or a component prop;
- tag styles that have never been set; reserved class names;
- placeholders, slot names, variant props exposed from nested instances.

How to enter a value with variables: select the class, switch to the
breakpoint, type `calc(` in the field and insert variables with the
variable picker. Gradients: Backgrounds → gradient, pick each stop from the
variables.

Letters run A, B, C… then AA, AB… and are never reused, so a letter
mentioned in GOTCHAS or a commit stays unambiguous.
