# <CLIENT> — design handoff → Webflow build

The brief every build session starts from. Written when the design is
approved (by the designer, or at the end of the prototype phase) and kept
current during the build. Agents read it after `AGENTS.md` and `GOTCHAS.md`.

## Read first

1. `AGENTS.md`, `GOTCHAS.md`, and the skill's `conventions.md`.
2. This file, then `MANUAL-TODO.md` and `BUILD-NOTES.md` in this folder.
3. The approved design: <prototype folder and its URL, Figma file, or both>.

## Status

## Ground rules for this project

- <Who gives the go-ahead for Webflow writes, and how.>
- <Anything that differs from conventions.md, agreed with the designer.>
